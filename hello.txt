Thailand has finally something to cheer about \u2013 The King's Birthday.Thailand's protesters have decided to halt the demonstrations in wake of the 86th birthday of their revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej.As the country in mired in protests, all eyes were on the speech made by the King, who enjoys a diety-type reverence.However, the King did not mention the protests directly and just called for the peace and unity.Addressing the nation on his birthday from his palace in the town of Hua Hin, the King asked the people to remain united and perform their duties for the common good of all.Hailing the country for its cuture of peace, the King said, \"Our nation has always been in peace for very long time because there is unity in our nation..Each of us performs our duties in a harmonious manner for the sake of our country.", "\"\"Every Thai should realize this, and perform their given duties to benefit the broader public,\" he urged the citizens.King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is also known as Rama IX has been reigning since 9 June 1946, and hence is the world's longest-serving current head of state along with being the longest-reigning monarch in Thai history.The King, who is revered as a moral authority and a unifying figure in Thailand, holds a special place in hearts of the citizens and hence the protesters agreed to avoid any violence on this day as a mark of respect.Interestingly, the same protesters who were just days ago seen pelting stones at security men triggering violent clashes, were now busy cleaning the streets shoulder-to-shoulder with the government forces.According to local media reports, people had queued up near one of the palaces of the King.Special trains and buses have been organised to escort scores of people to the town of Hua Hin, near the king's Klai Kangwon palace, said the BBC citing the Bangkok Post reports.The King would be addressing the nation later in the day which would be marked by festivities.However, this peaceful episode in Thailand is not expected tolast long as the protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban reportedly said that the demonstrations would begin afresh after the King's Birthday.Thai protesters have been protesting for a week now, with the demonstrations taking an ugly violent streak when people tried to barge in the Government House on Sunday and Monday triggering clashes between anti-govt protesters and the security men, who fired tear gases and water cannons at the rock-hurling protesters.Wanting to topple the Yingluck Shinawatra government, Thai protesters have been alleging that the current government is being run as a puppet regime by PM's brother Thaksin Shinawatra.The demonstrators want to replace Yingluck's government with an unelected \"people's council.Thaksin was ousted in 2006 in a coup after being accused of corruption and abuse of power.Four people have been dead in the recent demonstrations Thailand, which are the biggest protests since 2010 when 90 people had been dead.At least four people have died since Saturday, in what has been Thailand's worst political turmoil since the 2010 rallies that ended in violence."], "source": " Zee News", "link":

in yellow, green or blue hues.Unfortunately, this year is not very favourable for watching the Geminids as the peak of the meteor showers will coincide with the Waxing Gibbous Moon (93% full).The Geminid meteors are created by tiny bits of rocky debris that originate from small asteroid named 3200 Phaethon, which is in a highly elliptical 1.4 year orbit.", "Over the centuries these bits have spread all along the asteroid\u2019s orbit to form a sparse, moving \u201criver of rubble\u201d hundreds of millions of miles long.The point of origin of the shower appears to lie in the direction of the constellation of Gemini, from which the meteor derives its name Geminids.The Earth every year during mid-December passes through these debris trails, which allows the bits to enter the atmosphere where they disintegrate to create fiery and colourful streaks in the sky.", "This year, the meteor shower will be active from December 4 through December 17, with the peak activity occurring on December 13 and December 14.Initially, anywhere from 5 to 10 meteors per hour will be visible at night, leading up to 100-120 meteors per hour during the peak days with a velocity of 35 km (22 miles) per second.According to the information on NASA's website, Geminids are best viewed during the night starting around 9 or 10 pm and pre-dawn hours and are visible across the globe due to a nearly 24-hour broad maximum.Geminids are extremely bright and fast meteors capable of producing fireballs."], "source": " Zee News", "link":
